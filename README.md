This is a simple demo just aimed to show how to create reactive forms in Angular 11 \
There are 3 things we need to know to understand reactive forms
1. Form Control: This is the grassroot level element. This is used track value of controls and validate individual controls in a form
2. Form group: This is simply a collection of form controls
3. Form Builder: This is an injectable provider. its not necessary but it makes reactive forms easy
